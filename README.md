## Notes for me for when I (inevitably) forget what I did

- Referenced (this site by Amy Hanlon)[http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html] for most of the general steps
- Used the virtualenv method to setup Pelican
- ignoring Wordpress archive with .git/info/exclude 
-- I have no idea what I'm doing
